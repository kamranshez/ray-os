# Ensure Anki + AnkiConnect are up and stable before the pipeline touches them.
#
# Why this exists: every mode (video/bank/replace) needs AnkiConnect on :8765.
# If Anki is closed — or, as happens on Ray's machine, it crashes once during a
# big-collection load right after launch — the scripts die mid-run with
# "Connection refused". This launches Anki if it's down, waits for AnkiConnect
# to answer, and confirms it stays up (3 pings) so a one-shot reply during a
# flaky load doesn't fool us. Idempotent: a no-op when Anki is already healthy.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/ensure_anki.sh
# Exit 0 = AnkiConnect reachable and stable; exit 1 = give up, tell the user.
#
# Honors config.json's anki_connect_url if set (defaults to localhost:8765).
